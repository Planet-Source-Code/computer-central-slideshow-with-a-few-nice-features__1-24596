### Description

This is a simple program I wrote for my frineds to view pictures that I burned onto a cd for them. It has a resize (fit-to-screen) algorythm for pictures that are larger than the desktop resolution. It also includes an on-the-fly timer adjustment (with an estimatated viewing lenght display). It'll also display the filename if you wish. This is my first PSC upload, so please let me know what you think. thanx
